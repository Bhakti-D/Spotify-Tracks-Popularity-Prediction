Spotify is incredibly popular Swedish audio streaming and media service provider and it is one of the largest music streaming service providers with over 406 million monthly active users180 million paying subscribers. I am going to apply machine learning classification algorithms to predict the popularity of tracks   and pick the best algorithm based on success metrics.

### Objective – 

Predict the popularity of tracks based on several independent features. This is a binary classification Problem where popularity will be predicted in two classes to check with given inputs the track will be popular or unpopular. 

### Models Used for Prediction:

Logistic Regression
XG-Boost
K-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree Classification
Random Forest Classification

## Data –
